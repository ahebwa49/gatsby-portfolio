That’s why I started learning how to code, and it took years for me to learn everything needed to build an app."

Here is my main content
It is very interesting.

We tried to exhaust all free methods before dipping into our limited budget. We figured Product Hunt would be a great place to make a splash in the development community. After reading how to make it happen we were finished in around 20 minutes. On launch day over 7,000 people viewed our website and 1,200 users signed up. We battled for a top-five spot all day before falling to eighth by closing time. This was awesome! One thing we noticed was that even though we converted over 1,200 people we didn’t get very many upvotes on Product Hunt in comparison. To battle that, we decided to personalize the experience if you came from Product Hunt by giving you a little nudge to direct you back to the site after making a group and entry.
